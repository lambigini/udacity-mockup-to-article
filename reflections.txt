Your response goes here!
Htmt syntaxs, structure, element, do the research base on hint, read the MDN reference
Everything seem easy at the moment
The indentation is the hard part, I forgot to do it all the time, it makes looking the code more difficult
Iâ€™m not using the problem solving strategies from the first project yet
